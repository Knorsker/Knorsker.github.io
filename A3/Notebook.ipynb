    "* What is your dataset?\n",
    "\n",
    "Our dataset is called 'Cykelstativer' and is from the website Opendata.dk. It contains various information about the number and placement of bike stands in Copenhagen. We have utilized both the CSV file and GeoJSON file to enable various plot options. In addition to these two files, we have also utilized the dataset called 'Bydele,' which includes a GeoJSON file. This file is used to plot the placement and number of bike stands in different parts of the city on a map. Since the dataset only contains approximately 6000 data points, we was recommended to support the dataset with more data. \n",
    "\n",
    "To support the dataset 'Cykelstativer', we found a dataset  called 'Befolkning' of the population in the different districts in Copenhagen, corresponding to the same districts as in the dataset 'Bydele'. This dataset contains the population measured from 2000 to 2024 almost every quater. \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, we added a dataset called 'Cykeltællinger', which contains information about the amount for bikes in a given spot in the main roads in Copenhagen. Moreover, the data are divided into date and time, location and streetname. The data are measured from 2005 to 2014, divided into one Excel file for each year.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Why did you choose this/these particular dataset(s)?\n",
    "\n",
    "We chose these datasets as we thought it would be interesting to get a understanding if the bike usage in Copenhagen and if there is enough bikestands for the daily coumuters of Copenhagen. Moreover, we would like to dive into the fact that some bike racks are overcrowded, as well as that there are many bikes randomly placed in the general image of Copenhagen. \n",
    "\n",
    "* What was your goal for the end user's experience?\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to be an informative website, showing bike patterns plotting weekly and monthly number of bikes for each year. After the user has gotten some fundamental patterns of bike usages, we want to give them a better overveiw of the evalution of bike racks and population for each city part of Copenhagen. This gives the user some insights if these evulations follows along each other, and we will make an analysis of the development over time.\n",
    "Finally to get a more visual context to our analysis, we want to guide the user tthrough different geoplot, showing the placement of the bike racks in Copenhagen. Here it is possible to get an idea if there are any regions, where there will be room for improvement of the placement or number of racks. Here the ownership is an important part, as the has something to say about the availability.\n",

    "2. __Basic stats.__ Let's understand the dataset better\n",
    "* Write about your choices in data cleaning and preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking into the basics of the dataset 'Cykelstativer', we could see that some bike racks are allocated with 0 bike spots. To clean the dataset, we choose to exclude the data points with 0 bike spots, as these do not make sense to take into account.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the Bike count data, we did no cleaning of it. The data is very different from what we have used before, as each row has multiple data points. Therefore it was nessecary to make preproccesing of it, where for the monthly plot, we added an extra column containing the total number of bikes that day. While for the 168 hours bar plot, we had to reshape the data, so it had a seperate row for each timeslot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally we had the population data, which was extracted from the City of Copenhagen Statbank. This data was also a little difficult to process, as we had to import it for each quantile for every year. Extracting this data they had different names, where some quantiles were called *year-k1*, where k1 stands for quantile-1, while other were named a specific date. Therefore we had to convert all the names to be something similar making it simplier to use the data for plotting.\n",

    "Calculating the standard statistic of this data, we get a mean about 3989.84 and a std 4564.70 for one measurement. These numbers give a strong indication of the data having a wide spread and is not normally distributed. This variability could imply that the data contains outliers or that there are significant differences between individual data points, which we also has seen, since minimum is 0 and maximum is 37316. \n",

    "To get a idea of the bike rack dataset, we looked at how many of the data points were given a date for establishment. This is because of the analysis we made about the evalution of bike spots over time, where will need the date. The total amount of spots are 26731, from that spots with a missing date is 4383.0. Therefore it is only possible for us to plot 22348 spots.\n",
