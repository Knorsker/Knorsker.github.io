    "* What is your dataset?\n",
    "\n",
    "One of datasets is called 'Cykelstativer' and is from the website Opendata.dk. It contains various information about the number and placement of bike stands in Copenhagen. We have utilized both the CSV file and GeoJSON file to enable various plot options. In addition to these two files, we have also utilized the dataset called 'Bydele,' which includes a GeoJSON file. This file is used to plot the placement and number of bike stands in different parts of the city on a map. Since the dataset only contains approximately 6000 data points, we were recommended to support the dataset with more data. \n",
    "\n",
    "To support the dataset 'Cykelstativer', we found a dataset  called 'Befolkning', which consist data of the population in the different districts in Copenhagen, corresponding to the same districts as in the dataset 'Bydele'. This dataset contains the population measured from 2000 to 2024 almost every quater. \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, we added a dataset called 'Cykeltællinger', which contains information about the amount for bikes in a given spot in the main roads in Copenhagen. Moreover, the data are divided into date and time, location and streetname. The data are measured from 2005 to 2014, divided into one Excel file for each year.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Why did you choose this/these particular dataset(s)?\n",
    "\n",
    "We chose these datasets as we thought it would be interesting to get a understanding of the bike usage in Copenhagen and if there is enough bikestands for the daily coumuters of Copenhagen. Moreover, we would like to dive into the fact that some bike racks are overcrowded, as well as that there are many bikes randomly placed in the general image of Copenhagen. \n",
    "\n",
    "* What was your goal for the end user's experience?\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to be an informative website, showcasing bike usage patterns by plotting weekly and monthly numbers of bikes for each year. After the user has gained some fundamental insights into bike usage, we aim to provide them with a better overview of the evolution of bike racks and population for each district of Copenhagen. This gives the user some insights if these evolutions align with each other, and we will make an analysis of the development over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally to get a more visual context to our analysis, we want to guide the user through different geoplots, showing the placement of the bike racks in Copenhagen. Here it is possible to get an idea if there are any districts, where there will be room for improvement of the placement or number of racks. Here the ownership is an important part, as the has something to say about the availability.\n",

    "* Write about your choices in data cleaning and preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking into the basics of the dataset 'Cykelstativer', we could see that some bike racks are allocated with 0 bike spots. To clean the dataset, we choose to exclude the data points with 0 bike spots, as these do not make sense to take into account.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the Bike count data, we did no cleaning of it. The data is very different from what we have used before, as each row has multiple data points. Therefore it was nessecary to make preproccesing of it, where for the monthly plot, we added an extra column containing the total number of bikes that day. While for the 168 hours bar plot, we had to reshape the data, so it had a seperate row for each timeslot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally we had the population data, which was extracted from the City of Copenhagen Statbank. This data was also a little difficult to process, as we had to import it for each quantile for every year. Extracting this data they had different names, where some quantiles were called *year-k1*, where k1 stands for quantile-1, while other were named a specific date. Therefore we had to convert all the names to be something similar making it simplier to use the data for plotting.\n",

    "Calculating the standard statistics of this data, we obtain the mean = 3989.84 and the standard deviation = 4564.70 for the created column 'total_value,' which contained the sum of bikes on that day on one of the streets. These numbers give a strong indication of the data having a wide spread and not being normally distributed. The variability could imply that the data contains outliers or that there are significant differences between individual data points, which we also has seen, since minimum is 0 and maximum is 37316. Plots of the distributions can be seen on our website under the section *Temporal Trends and Seasonal Patterns of Bike Activity in Copenhagen*.\n",

The total number of spots is 26731, with 4383.0 spots missing dates. Therefore, we can only plot 22348 spots.

    "Next, when examining the evolution of population and bike spots, we observed that they do not necessarily correlate, and that there can many reasons for this. In certain areas while the population remains stable, there is an increase in bike spots. This occurrence is often attributed to Copenhagen's status as a capital, attracting commuters from other cities. Also we noticed significant jumps in the evaluation of bike spots for some districts, which could mean that some people did not report the establishment dates correct.\n",

For 'Highlighting' we have used the tool Zooming in our geoplots, as it is possible for the user, to look closer at the bik racks placement. For 'Transition Guidance,' we utilized the tools of Familiar Objects and Viewing Angle. On our website, we ensure consistency by using familiar terms and perspectives to results found earlier. Additionally, we adjust our viewpoint later in the story when discussing bike racks and population. These tools helps us to maintain coherence throughout our narrative. \n",

Later, we continued to use linear ordering, arranging the city districts alphabetically. In the category 'Interactivity,' we employed the Filtering/Selection tool because it enables users to filter and select items in a way that makes sense for them. Additionally we provide guidance within the text to help readers understand our analysis from the interactive plots. For 'Messaging,' we utilized tools such as Captions, Annotations, and Summary text. On our website, every plot and section includes a Caption. Additionally, we provide brief figure texts summarizing the plot and figure annotation, along with more in-depth summaries within the analysis text, where it is possible to refer to the figure using the annotation. These elements helps to assist the reader in understanding the plot and contribute to telling the story effectively.\n"

Also, when analyzing the data through our story, it was clear that some of the sets were inconsistent. Two things with our plots could be improved. In our interactive line plot, we would have liked to group the labels within each district, so when choosing a city district, it would automatically plot the population and number of bike spots for that. Also, it could have been very nice if we could have combined our geoplots, so it would be possible to select the unit plotted in the bar beside it."
