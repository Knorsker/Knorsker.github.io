    "\n",
    "Our dataset is called 'Cykelstativer' and is from the website Opendata.dk. It contains various information about the number and placement of bike stands in Copenhagen. We have utilized both the CSV file and GeoJSON file to enable various plot options. In addition to these two files, we have also utilized the dataset called 'Bydele,' which includes a GeoJSON file. This file is used to plot the placement and number of bike stands in different parts of the city on a map. Since the dataset only contains approximately ?6000? data points, we was recommended to support the dataset with more data. \n",
    "\n",
    "To support the dataset 'Cykelstativer', we found a dataset  called 'Befolkning' of the population in the different districts in Copenhagen, corresponding to the same districts as in the dataset 'Bydele'. This dataset contains the population measured from 2000 to 2024 almost every quater. \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, we added a dataset called 'Cykelt√¶llinger', which contains information about the amount for bikes in a given spot in the main roads in Copenhagen. Moreover, the data are divided into date and time, location and streetname. The data are measured from 2005 to 2014, divided into one Excel file for each year.\n",

    "We chose these datasets as we thought it would be interesting to get a understanding if the bike infrastructure is sufficentent for supporting environmental transition and if there is ennough bikestands for the daily coumuters of Copenhagen. Moreover, we would like to dive into the fact that some bike racks are overcrowded, as well as that there are many bikes randomly placed in the general image of Copenhagen. \n",
